# Schedule Generator - Alex Wilson

This project is a simple schedule generator that processes the data input from the form into a randomized
schedule that adheres to the input constraints of days of the week and hours available. There are fields for the employees 
name, the earliest they can come in, the latest they can work until, and the days of the week they are available. As of now 
the generated schedule only appears one at a time. This is because it changes based on the current state.
